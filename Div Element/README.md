#DIV element

##Definition:
Div is a block-level container that is used to wrap other elements within a container so that other styling and layout could be applied to it.

###Key Features
1) Container for other elements
   -> It is used to hold other block level or inline elements within it.
2) No default styling
   -> It doesn't have any default styling which makes it flexible for custom designs.
3) Non-Semantic
   -> Even though it is customisable, it is non-semantic in nature which means that it doesn't convey a particular meaning to what it contains by default.
4) Block-Level Element
   -> And as mentioned, it is a block-level element which means that it takes up the whole width of the document and always starts with a new line.
