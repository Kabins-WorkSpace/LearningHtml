# CSS Display Property

The elements in the Html document can be broadly classified into three types based on their display property. They are:

- Block element -> These elements like <p> take up the whole page.
- In-Line Block element -> These elements take only the required space.
- In-Line element -> These elements appear within the line of the text element.

And the elements can be changed from one type to other by changing its display property within the CSS file. Following exercises were implemented to solidify these understandings.
