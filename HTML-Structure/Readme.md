# HTML Structure

In this lesson, I learnt about the structure of a HTML document. The browser needs to identify the type of HTML and its parts so that it can assess the items in it to be able to display properly as a webpage.

HTML document is divided into 4 parts mainly. They are:
- Doctype Declaration -> It helps to identify which version of HTML is being used in the file.
- HTML -> It creates the start and end of the html file along with the other necessary information like the charset that's being used in the document.
- HEAD -> Contains the title and links that includes the stylesheets and other necessary informations that are being implemented.
- BODY -> Everything thats visible in the webpage is included in here.

In order to understand the html structure, the following exercise was done.
