In this chapter, I learnt about how we can style text. For this we use CSS style properties.

The text elements that I got to be familiar with:
                -> font-style
                -> font-family
                -> font-weight
                -> font-size
                -> margin
                -> padding
                -> coloring of text & background

Also, in order to change the attribute of the text within the same paragraph, we use span along with a class name which we can later on use to style further in a specific manner.
