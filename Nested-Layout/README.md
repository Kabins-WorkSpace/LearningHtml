# Nested Layout

It is the building block of web development where one element is created inside of another element using parent-child relationship. This process helps to create structured, maintainable and visually appealing web documents.
Elements can be arranged in a horigontal or vertical layout and <div> element is mostly used for this purpose.
## Key Points

      - A child can be the parent of another child element as well creating a complex nested structure.
