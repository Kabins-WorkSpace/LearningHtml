# Nested Layout

It is the building block of web development where one element is created inside of another element using parent-child relationship. This process helps to create structured, maintainable and visually appealing web documents.
Elements can be arranged in a horigontal or vertical layout and <div> element is mostly used for this purpose.
## Key Points

### 1. Hierarchy and Parent-Child Relationships
      - It helps to maintain the hierarchy between the elements utilising the parent-child relationship.
      - A child can be the parent of another child element as well creating a complex nested structure.

### 2. Creating Complex layouts
      - The organisation of elements as a complex nested structure makes it easier to apply styling and layout to these elements.
      - CSS flexbox and grid are powerful styling technique that can be used effectively on a nested layout.
