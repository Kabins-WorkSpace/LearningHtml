# CSS Position

CSS position provides a fundamental way to control the layout and positioning of elements on a webpage. It helps to position the element on a webpage relative to its parent or original positioning.

Fixed and static are two important ways to position an element.

## Static
- It is a default positioning.
- Left, right, top, bottom plays no effect on the positioning of an element.
- Elements are positioned according to the normal flow of the document.

## Fixed 
- Elements are positioned according to the viewport and fixed in the screen when scrolled.
- Adjusted using the left, right, top and bottom properties.
- Elements are taken out of the normal document flow.
